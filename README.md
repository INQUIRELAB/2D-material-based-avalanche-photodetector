# 2D-material-based-avalanche-photodetector
Van der Waals BP/MLG avalanche photodiode design for uncooled, room-temperature mid-IR (3–8 µm) detection. Uses a field-engineered p+–i–p–n+ heterostructure to sustain a strong depletion field for controlled avalanche gain, high responsivity, and improved detectivity.
